# LyonWater_DataAnalysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world water trial data using machine learning techniques to classify water quality outcomes. 
The goal is to uncover patterns in the dataset that can help predict results of future trials and support better environmental decision-making. 
It was completed as part of my ongoing interest in using data science for sustainability and public impact.

Objectives
- Clean and preprocess environmental data using Python and pandas.
- Apply a Random Forest Classifier to predict trial outcomes.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- Visualize key trends and feature importance to interpret the model's behavior.

Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model building
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for documentation and reproducibility

Key Features
- Feature extraction and analysis from real-world water quality data.
- Random Forest model implementation for classification.
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix.
- Clean, modular code and readable notebook format.

Sustainability Relevance
Water access and quality are at the core of environmental justice.
